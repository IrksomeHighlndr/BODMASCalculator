# BODMASCalculator
Calculator that supports basic arithmetic operators and follows BODMAS.
It recursively parse the entire input by tokenizing the sting and then solving for it.

### Note
I will try and seperate the solving from parsing and make an intrepreter for it!
Also its C++ there are a lot of refactoring so bear with me.
